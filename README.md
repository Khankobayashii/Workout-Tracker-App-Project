# **Workout Tracker App**
This Workout Tracker App is a Flutter application that helps users manage and track their workouts. It includes core features for logging workouts and accessing routines, along with a basic backend for user authentication using SQLite. This project serves as my foundational internship project, focusing on building practical skills in frontend development and implementing simple backend functionality.
